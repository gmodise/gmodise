- About me
  
  I'm a dedicated student with a burning curiosity for all things tech. My journey began with tinkering around with HTML and CSS, but now I'm diving deep into the world of full-stack development.
  
  Here's what defines me:
  
  
  Iâ€™m interested in:
  Full-Stack Enthusiast
   I'm fascinated by both front-end and back-end technologies. From crafting beautiful user interfaces to designing robust APIs, I love it all.
  
  Problem Solver:
  I thrive on challenges. Debugging code, optimizing performance, and finding elegant solutions keep me up at night (in a good way!).
  
  Continuous Learning:
   Whether it's a new framework, language, or best practice, I'm always hungry to learn. Conferences, online courses, and late-night coding sessions are my jam.
  
  Team Player:
   Collaboration fuels innovation. I enjoy working with diverse teams, learning from others, and contributing to open-source projects.
